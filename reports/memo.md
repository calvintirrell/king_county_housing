Potential audiences:

1) Homeowners wanting to increase the sale price of their homes through home remodeling
2) Groups advocating for affordable housing
3) Local elected officials wanting to understand how their ideas (e.g. zoning changes, permitting) could impact home prices
4) Real estate investors looking for potential "fixer-uppers" or "tear-downs"

----------------------

1) A summary of the business problem:

Our group (Jarod, Sam and Calvin) is trying to build a predictive model to correlate certain features to the sale price of a home. These features can include a fairly wide range of factors including, but not limited to, the following:
    
    - Physical characteristics of the home building itself (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, etc)
    - Information about the land which the home is built (property lot size, waterfront (or not), historic site)
    - General location (city, zip code, topography of the land (flat, mountains, valley), etc)
    - Hazards or nuisances nearby (steep slopes for landslides, power lines, heavy traffic roads, airport noise)

2) Key takeaways from your solution: (to be upated once we are closer to the end of the project)
