# Project: Relation of Home Prices to Home Features using King County Data

# Process
Our process started off with each of the three group members individually exploring the data.
For example, what did certain column names of the data mean or how was the data represented (numbers vs text).
After this initial exploration, our group came together to figure out what our working dataset should contain.
This single file of data is what we having been working off of in order to find the best correlations.

# Methodology
Trial and error has been our main method of trying to find what features from our data correlate to higher home prices.
The specific way in which our group has been trying to find these relationship is by using a Logistic Regression model.

# Findings
This is still in progress and will be updated near the end of the project.
