# Relation of Home Prices to Home Features using King County Data

# Process
Our process started off with each of the three group members individually exploring the data.
For example, what did certain column names of the data mean or how was the data represented (numbers vs text)?
After this initial exploration, our group came together to figure out what our working dataset should contain.
According to the requirements of the project, our data should only contain housing data from 2019.
This single file of data is what we having been working from in order to find the best correlations possible.

# Methodology
Trial and error has been our main method of trying to find what features from our data correlate to higher home prices.
The specific way in which our group has been trying to find these relationship is by using a Logistic Regression model.
One issue we have had to watch out for while using the Logistic Regression model is something called Multicollinearity.
Testing for low multicollinearity scores, maximum of 5, is straightforward and documented in our group's code.
Please note that a maximum score of 5 was set by our group and not a de facto standard to always use.

# Findings
This is still in progress and will be updated near the end of the project.
